# BCB546_R_Assignment_Spring2025
##Submitted by Shirin Parvin

This repository is used to perform the R assignment for BCB546 for Spring 2025. The repository contains a **R Markdown** file called `R Assignment.Rmd` which contains the code, the explanations of the code and the plots generated using the code for the given questions in the R assignment. There are 40 additional files generated as part of the assignment. The details of these files are as follows:
1. 10 files for **Maize** genotype information, corresponding to each chromosome where the missing data is encoded by **'?'** symbol and the SNP positions are arranged in **ascending** order. These files are in .txt format. They are named as 'maize_chr_1.txt', 'maize_chr_2.txt' etc.
2. 10 files for **Maize** genotype information, corresponding to each chromosome where the missing data is encoded by **'-'** symbol and the SNP positions are arranged in **descending** order. These files are in .txt format. They are named as 'maize_rev_chr_1.txt', 'maize_rev_chr_2.txt' etc.
3. 10 files for **Teosinte** genotype information, corresponding to each chromosome where the missing data is encoded by **'?'** symbol and the SNP positions are arranged in **ascending** order. These files are in .txt format. They are named as 'teo_chr_1.txt', 'teo_chr_2.txt' etc.
4. 10 files for **Teosinte** genotype information, corresponding to each chromosome where the missing data is encoded by **'-'** symbol and the SNP positions are arranged in **descending** order. These files are in .txt format. They are named as 'teo_rev_chr_1.txt', 'teo_rev_chr_2.txt' etc.

   The generated plots will be published in the R markdown file. The R Markdown is knit and published as a HTML file.
