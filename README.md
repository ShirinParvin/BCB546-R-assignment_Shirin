This project is created as part of the BCB546 class of Spring 2025.
The author is Shirin Parvin.
This project will contain several folder created as part of the "Challenge" sections of the R lessons taught in the class.
Additionally, it might contain files generated to solve the R assignment (subject to change upon further thought and mood swings. LOL)
